An ongoing project to understand the fundamental algorithms and data structures.
This is based on the coursework provided by pashka (Pavel Marvin).
It is hosted at [Gitlab link](https://gitlab.com/salgarkaraaditya/algorithm-course-by-pashka).

It also contains the solutions to several standard and important algorithmic problems created by Antti Laaksonen. The problems can be accessed at [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/).
