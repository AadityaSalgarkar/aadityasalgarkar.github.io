I am a PhD in theoretical physics interested in programming, optimization and artificial intelligence. My interests include:

- Energy based models
- Optimizations
- Fine tuning using verifiable rewards

**Education:**
- PhD in Theoretical Physics, University of Porto (2023)
- Integrated Masters in Physics, Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (2016)

During my PhD, my research interest revolved around conformal field theory and its relation to quantum gravity via AdS/CFT correspondence. Using the general quantitative aptitude developed through this study, I am interested in exploring the field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
